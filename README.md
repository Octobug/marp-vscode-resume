### Customizing CSS

This is a template modified based on the [Marp Gaia theme](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core/tree/main/themes#gaia), not an out-of-the-box tool, so you may need to tweak details according to your preferences.

- The theme style file is [`.marp/theme.css`](.marp/theme.css)
- For customizing Marp themes, please refer to: [Use custom theme CSS üõ°Ô∏è](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-vscode#use-custom-theme-css-%EF%B8%8F)
- If you want to further customize styles based on Gaia, please refer to its original style file: [marp-core/themes/gaia.scss](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core/blob/main/themes/gaia.scss)

#### Debugging CSS?

1. Export the HTML file
2. Use the browser's developer tools
